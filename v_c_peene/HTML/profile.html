      <h1>Hi! Welcome to my corner of the Internet!</h1>
      <p>My name is Veerle, but I also respond to Veer. I'm 23 years old, Dutch, and, most
         importantly, a huge book lover (I'm assuming you guys are too). I grew up in the South of
         the Netherlands, in a very small town on the seaside and naturely love the beach. I moved
         to Leiden four years ago for my studies, and I love it here! I did my BA in English
         Language and Culture at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en"> Leiden
            University</a> after which I took a small gap year. In these 8 months I travelled a lot,
         with the absolutele highlight being the month I spent in Vietnam with my boyfriend. The
         other months I spent by going on shorter trips to places such as London, Paris, Istanbul,
         and many more, all alternated with working at a restaurant in Leiden called the Waag. This
         was a great way to spend my time, but I'm happy to have started going to university again.
         I'm excited about the MA BDMS and its program, and look forward to studying with you guys!

            <td>My prior knowledge regarding books in the digital age is very minimal. I know how to use my MacBook Air, 
               at least most features, and that is where my digital skills end. This is my very first time using HTML, 
               or any of these programs. Where my real knowledge lies is the field of e-books, the reading of them that is ;).

            <td>I expect to learn a lot during this course, in fact, I have already learnt a lot whilst creating this HTML! 
            The digital side to the publishing world is completely new to me, which makes it exciting, and I hope to gain a 
            deeper understanding of this field. My biggest hope is that after this MA, I have a more focused plan for my future
            in terms of employment, and I expect this course to create a more complete picture of the publishing world for my,
            which in turn can help me in my search for the field I want to work in.
