Dear M. Woolf, 
              Thank you very much 
indeed for your kind letters, and 
cheque for Â£25 as bonus for the 
past year, it was nice of you 
to write to me and I do appreciate
it and, needless to say, the 
cheque will be most useful! 
              I quite understand that 
in the general upheaval there was 
no opportunity of saying goodbye
and I would like to say how 
nice it was wondering for the 
press for the five years I was 
with you. 
              Yours sincerely, 
              Barbara Gee.
