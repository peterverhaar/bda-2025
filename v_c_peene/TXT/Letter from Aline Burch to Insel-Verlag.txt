Dear Dr. Michael, 

    We have been asked by Dr. L.L. 
Weltmann to let you have a copy of 
SADO by William Plomer and I have 
pleasure in enclosing a copy.   Dr. 
Weltmann thinks that you would like
to consider this book with a view to 
a German translation and that you might
probably be interested in Mr. Plomer's
work as a whole.    We very much hope 
that you will be impressed by SADO 
and shall look forward to hearing 
from you about it in due course. 

        Yours sincerely, 
        
        
        for the Hogarth Press Ltd. 
        
Dr. Friedich Michael, 
Insel-Verlag, 
Karlstrasse 38, 
Weisbaden, Germany.
