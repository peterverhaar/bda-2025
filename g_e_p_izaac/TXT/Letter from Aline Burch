Dear Sir,

Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego: Sigmund Freud 	[hand underlined]

Thank you for your letter of May 2. 

We are putting in hand at once your order for 2600/2500 folded/colladed sheets of the above book.

As these sheets are not being printed by the same firm as THE FUTURE OF ILLUSION, I wonder if you could let us have another stereo of your collophon?

With regard to the price, we have gone into the figures again, and although this is cutting things very fine for us, we feel that we should like to meet you in this particular instance.

We will, therefore, invoice the sheets to you at 2s. 2d. instead of 2s. 4d. as previously quoted.	[hand underlined]

Yours truly, 

For The Hogarth Press Ltd. 

Arthur Pell, Esq.,
