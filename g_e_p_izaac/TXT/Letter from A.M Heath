John Lehmann Esq.,
The Hogarth Press,
601 Carrington House,
Hertford Street, W.L.

Dear Mr. Lehmann, 

You may, by now, have heard that Dr.Smeriglio, Documento, Editore, Libraio, Via Principesse Clotilde 5, Rome, is interested in the possibility of Italian publication of DEATH OF MY AUNT.

We understand he wrote to you at 52 Tavistock Square, W.C.L. but had no answer.

Would you let him know something by writing an air letter [x][handwritten] to R. Orlando, H.Q., 12 “Polindep” Unit, C.M.F who is authorised to conduct correspondence on his behalf.

Dr. Smeriglio tells us information on his firm [c][corrected]an be obtained from Dr. Ruffini, Cultural Attache of the Italian ambassador, Hotel Claridge, London, or Major Ian Greenless, formerly of the British Consul, Rome, and now working with Psychological Warfare Branch, Italian Headquarters, Via Veneta 62, Rome

This is, of course, nothing to do with our agency, but we are dealing with Dr. Smeriglio about another matter and he asked us to check up on this.

Yours Sincerely, 

/Pa\tience Ross
