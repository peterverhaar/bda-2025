<h1>Hi! I'm Eva</h1>
<p>Actually, no I'm not. <i>Technically</i>, Eva is only my <i>given</i> name, and all officaly documents, including the student registry, use my <i>first</i> name which is Geertje. No one ever calls me by this name, and it's essentially the Dutch equivalant of Gertrude, so I definitey do not prefer it.
    I'm 24 years old, I use they/them pronouns (die/hen in het Nederlands), and I'm from Breda - The Pearl of the South, if our city's anthem is to be believed - but I've lived in Leiden since 2021. In my free time I like to watch movies & TV, play videogames, draw, read, knit & crosstitch, play TTRPG's/Dungeons & Dragons, play guitar, and sing (I'm a member of a choir and orchestra association for students here in Leiden).
    </p>
    
<h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p> For my undergraduate I did Film and Literature Studies here at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en"> Leiden University</a>. Contrary to what you might assume for me being here with you all I took the film track instead of the literature track from my second year onwards. I do love reading, but as I have the attention span of a particularly slow ostrich and never managed to finish the books we had to read every week in my first year, film seemed the more natural fit. In my third year I followed a minor in Game Studies, also here in Leiden. This tied in very neatly with my eventual bachelor thesis on player agency in regards to choice-based romance gameplay gameplay in The Witcher 3.  </p>
 
<h2>Hopes and Dreams for This Course</h2>
    <table style= "width: 80%">
        <tr>
        <td style= "width: 20%">Prior Knowledge</td> <td>
                In terms of theoretical technical skill I've had a lot of lectures in both my bachelor and my minor on digital media and new media in general.
                When it comes to practical technical skill however, I would decribe my current level of technical skill as reasonable, but prone to mistakes.
                For the Video Game minor I had to design a level in a videogame. The actual design and construction of the level went well, but when it came to actually coding a key items meant to unlock a door I was literally driven to tears, so I am relieved to find out right now that this isn't as complicated. 
                Other than that, my most impressive feat of technical skill was when I managed to find and fix a bug that was causing my illegaly downloaded copy of The Sims 4 to fail to load (basically, the safe file got bloated due to a bug that caused the game spawning in infinite santa clauses. </td>
