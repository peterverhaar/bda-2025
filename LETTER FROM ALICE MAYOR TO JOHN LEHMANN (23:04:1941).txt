Dear Mr. Lehmann

I was very glad there about the increased sales of the (Robins Singhan??). Excuse my delay in answering, as I have hurt my hand. I agree with you that it would be more risk-confident in these days. But I should be extremely glad to have the book come out in a (6d??). Can you tell me what steps should be taken about it? I was delighted with your sister’s article – it had real understanding & discrimination which is so exceedingly rare. I wrote to thank her for it – I should be very glad if the arrangement to bring out the book as a (6d??) could be made as soon as possible – I suppose the Penguin is the best edition.

Yrs Sincerely,
A. M. Mayor
