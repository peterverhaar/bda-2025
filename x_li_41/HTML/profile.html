<p>Hi! My name is Xinrui (pronounced "Shin-ray") and I studied English Language and Culture at <a href= "https://www.universiteitleiden.nl">Leiden University</a>. I also exchanged at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk">University of St Andrews</a> for a semester.
I moved to the Netherlands from China when I was seven years old and have lived here ever since. I'm 22 years old (soon to be 23) and I am glad to have met all of you in this programme.
</p>
<p>For my BA thesis, I wrote about postcolonialism as a critical lens with regards to the representation of imagined technologies in <i>Star Wars</i> and I'm always happy to talk about it if anyone is interested.
</p>
<h3>Languages I speak</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Mandarin Chinese</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>English</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>My hobbies</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Reading books, comics, and fics</li>
<li>Playing videogames</li>
<li>Singing and dancing</li>
<li>Making stuff like sewing, crocheting, and 3D printing</li>
</ul>
Note that aside from reading, I do not claim any sort of mastery in these hobbies.
</p>
<h3>Knowledge and Expectations</h3>
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%">Prior Knowledge</td> <td><p>In terms of theory, I have some minor media theory knowledge from an <a href="https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/129990/imagining-media-infrastructure-information-interface">introductory media course</a> I took last year. In terms of practice, I have worked with some digital tools before. For a <a href="https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/124232/philology-6-middle-english-literature-and-culture">Middle English course</a> I took last semester, I transcribed and digitized parts of a <a href="https://lxnrui.github.io/middle-english-romance/src/content/homepage.xml">Middle English romance</a> using a TEI-boilerplate, which I lightly modified to better fit my purpose. I also took the <a href="https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/130498/data-science">Data Science</a> BA honours class last semester, which introduced me to Python.</p><p>I don't think this means that I'm "good" with these tools, but just that I'm not afraid to tinker with them.</p></td>

<tr>
<td>Expectations</td> <td><p>I want to work more on my skills and grow confident in them. I also want to explore more about the limits and possibilities of digital media and study its implication on book production, preservation, and innovation. </p></td>
