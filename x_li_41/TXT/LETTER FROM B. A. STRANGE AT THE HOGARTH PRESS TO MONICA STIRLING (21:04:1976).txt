Dear Mademoiselle Stirling

I refer to correspondence between our Miss Spurdle and yourself 
regarding the works of Virginia Woolf under the title of <hi rend="underline">La Mort
de la Phalene</hi>. As a result of her correspondence both with you
and with the French publisher, Editions du Seuil, it now seems
clear that an error has occurred over the payment of Royalties.

In 1968, Madame Arnaud instructed the publisher to pay 90% of
Royalties arising from the book <hi rend="underline">L'Art du Roman</hi> direct to Mr.
Leonard Woold and 10% to <del rend="overstrike">yourself</del> <add place="above">her</add>, and this appears to have been
carried out. But no such instruction was given regarding <hi rend="underline">La Mort
de la Phalene<hi>. Consequently, Editions du Seuil have continued to
pay all Royalties arising from this book, first to Madame Arnaud's
agency in 1969, then to M. Puisoye as her executor in 1970, 1971 and
1972, and in 1973 and 1974, to yourself, on the instructions of
M. Puisoye. The total amount paid was Frs. 1659.97 but in fact
the whole of this amount should have been remitted to the Estate of
Virginia Woolf except for 10% to Madame Arnaud during the time
her agency was still in existence. In fact, however, it appears
that none of this money has ever reached us for the Woolf Estate.
We have no means of knowing what happened to the payments which
Editions du Seuil made to the agency in 1969 (Frs. 638.23) nor to
the amount of Frs. 62.05 paid to M. Puisoye. But we are informed
by the publishers that for the years 1973 and 1974 they remitted to
you a total sum of Frs. 959.69. We should be very grateful if you
-2-
could send us a payment for this sum but in view of the fact that
it does not seem to be possible to contact M. Puisoye it would
seem the earlier Royalties due to the Estate cannot now be 
recover<del rend="overwritten">d</del>
 <add place="superimposed">e</add>d.

Yours sincerely
