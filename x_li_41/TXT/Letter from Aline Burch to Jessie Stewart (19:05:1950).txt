19th May, 1950.

Dear Madam,

As Mr. Lehmann has now left The
Hogarth Press and is publishing on his
own account, I am acknowledging your
letter, which I will pass to Mr.Woolf
when he is in the office next week.
Meanwhile, however, I should like to 
say that <hi rend="underline">Reminiscences of a Student's 
Life</hi> is obtainable and if you will refer
any enquirer to us, we shall be pleased
to supply copies while the stock lasts.

Yours faithfully,

for The Hogarth Press Ltd.

Miss J.G. Stewart
The Malting House,
Newnham Road,
Cambridge.
