    <h1>A Bit About Me</h1> 
       <img src="me.jpg" height="230" width="300"/>
    <p>Hi, I’m Ziyi! I’m from a city in central China famous for its tea culture. My academic background is in English and American studies. Before joining BDMS, I spent some time working and traveling. In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming, and music. Some of my favorite authors include Stefan Zweig and Herta Müller. I'm also a big fan of ACG culture—I'm particularly obsessed with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, though I do think the original manga artwork is better than the anime. And I’ve been doing game streaming on Twitch.
And I’m also an animal lover and have two dogs at home: an 11-year-old Teddy and a 13-year-old Bichon Frise.</p >
