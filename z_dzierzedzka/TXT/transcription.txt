Dear Mr. Wolfe,
	Mrs. Spencer Curtis Brown is away from the office at / the moment so I am writing to you in her abscence. We / have recieved an airmail from Mr. Ahmed Ali in which he / says: /
"Now that TWILIGHT IN DELHI has been included in / the list of books recommended to British soldiers / it should do very well indeed. This list, I find / will be distributed to all the British soldiers / in this country (India) or coming to it, and will / become operative in another couple of months. A / cheap edition therefore will be so much better and / an Indian edition, because easily avaliable in this / country will be better still. I  also discovered / that the novel won good points in a competition held / by two papers - the Illustrated Weekly of India and / the Bombay Chronicle. It was within the first twenty / books on India - which included the classics and / philosophies and other books in a Best Books com- / petition on India run by Pearl Book. TWILIGHT was / within the first ten books. Two Indian publishers / have been asking me to give them permission to bring / out an edition immediately, of 3000 copies."
	He is most anxious to have your permission for this / Indian edition to be brought out and I wonder, if, in the / circumstances, you would be willing to give your consent.
					Yours very truly
