<h2><i>pre-dutch era</i></h2>
    <p>I was born in Warsaw, the capital city of Poland on the 16th of June 2004, and with that 6 and 4 effectively became my favourite numbers. I spend my entire childhood in that city, so till today getting on the plane back to the NL stings a little. My adolescent years can be effectively summed up to books, music and a bit of post-soviet trauma. Throughout school I was always employed in organising performances for any and all celebrations. I sang in <a href=https://www.studiobuffo.com.pl/>the Buffo Musical Theatre</a>, <a href=https://akademiamusicalowa.pl/>Warsaw's Muscial Academy</a> and completed a first degree of music school in piano.  </p>

    <p>Alongside my melodically-tainted academic career I got into activism, joining <a href=https://rebellion.global/pl/groups/pl-poland/#groups>XR Poland</a>, which shaped my COVID years significantly. I miss the drive for action I had back then.

 <h2><i>dutch era</i></h2>
    <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences in <a href=https://www.auc.nl/>Amsterdam University College</a>. I majored in Humanities but AUC forces interdisciplinarity so I dabbled with ecology, political science, logic, religion studies and many many other disciplines. I was doing so much more then I knew was possible and adored every second of it.</p>
    <p>AUC is also the birthplace of my band <a href=https://www.instagram.com/isle_of_cvnts/>Isle of C*nts</a>. Pls pls pls follow us on instagram!</p>
