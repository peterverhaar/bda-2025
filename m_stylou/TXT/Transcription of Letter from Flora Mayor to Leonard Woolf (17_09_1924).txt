Dear Mr, Woolf
I have been won-
dering whether anything
could be done to take Camb-
ridge. What about an ad-
vertisement in ‘The Cambridge
Revièw’.? Cambridge is
mentioned so honourably
is 'The Rector's Daughter'
That I think, it ought to
show its appreciation. I
do not think any one has
printed at his superior it

is to Oxford. Personally I think
Cambridge has been
rather impatient about it.
yours sincerly,
FloraMayor
