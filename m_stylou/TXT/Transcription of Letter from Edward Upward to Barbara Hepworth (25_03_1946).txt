Dear Miss Hepworth,
Journey to the Border
I understand that
inquiries have been made to the Hogarth Press
by M. Perrin on behalf of the publisher Arthand
of Grenoble about issuing a French translation
of Journey to the Border. I shall be glad if
you will let me know whether there is any
possibility of negotiating an agreement with 
this firm.


Yours sincerely,


Edward Upward.
