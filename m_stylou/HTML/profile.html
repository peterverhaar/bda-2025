    <i>Who am I?</i>
</h2>

<p>
    My name is Myrto Stylou and I come from Greece. I had always been a person with their nose stuck in a book or daydreaming about different things. So it should not come to anyone's surprise that I chose to study about books.

<i> Basic backround info </i>
</h2>

<p>
I did my bachelor's in English and German in the Univeristy of Ferrara in Italy. Click <a href= "https://corsi.unife.it/lingue">here</a> if you want to see the site, it is in Italian so if you do not know any Italian you will just have to take my word for it. 
</p>

<p>
From that, you might have guessed that I do, in fact, speak Italian but if you are curious to know what more languages I speak, here is a list:
<ul>
<li> Greek (highly debatable sometimes)</li>
<li> English (the language that inspires me to write)</li>
<li> German (we will not get into more details)</li>
<li> Italian (already established but it looks nice on a list)</li>
<li> Korean (very, very basic)</li>
</ul>
