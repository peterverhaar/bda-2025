    <h1>Background info
    </h1>
    <p>I was born on May 5, 2003, in Sieradz, a small town in the heart of Poland. Growing up, books were my biggest escape, and thanks to my grandfather’s Cold War-era collection, I learned (unconsciously, of course) how stories can travel far beyond their time and place. At the same time, I was constantly falling in love with new movies - the year I saw 
        <i>Shrek</i> and
        <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> 
        back-to-back was truly life-defining. In my high school years, I also got involved in some creative projects, like co-creating an English-learning booklet for children, which was pretty rewarding and fun.

    <h2>University life 
    </h2>
    <p>This July, I completed my BA in French Philology at the 
        <a href="https://en.uw.edu.pl/"> University of Warsaw
            </a>. 
        While I focused on literature and language, I also co-founded the Francophone Literature Club, where I got to design its official logo and manage the finances as treasurer - juggling all of it taught me way more than I expected and was surprisingly fun. I like to think it gave me a head start on figuring out how to balance a million things at once in my adult life.
