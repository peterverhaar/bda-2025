        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sera (or actually, it's Sara, but way too many people are called like that
            in my city, so here we are) and I am 26 years old. I am from Italy, where I also
            graduated this year in English and Spanish languages, literatures and culture at <a
                href="https://www.uniecampus.it/">Università E-Campus</a> and <a
                href="https://www.uniroma3.it/en/">Università degli Studi Roma Tre</a>. I'm also an
            ex-professional waterpolo athlete and a non-professional crafter and cosplayer, which
            means I pretty much learned things from how to sew and embroider to how to photograph
            and edit, all things that can me quite useful at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>I could be considered manga and book collector (currently <i>just</i> 2000 manga are in
            my room back in Rome, and many more all over my house), and I am an avid player of both
            videogames (Baldur's Gate, my beloved) and tabletop role-playing games, such as
                <i>Dungeon and Dragons</i> or <i>Daggerheart</i>. My favourite books are <i>Throne
                of Glass</i>, the <i>Silmarillion</i> and <i>Confession of a Mask</i>, which means I
            love high fantasy, a mixture of Japanese/French/Russian literature and probably crying
            when I read. </p>

                    I already have a background in languages, literature, and some digital skills.  
                    My technical skills in web development and digital media are still basic and limited to years on Tumblr and Pinterest, but I’m eager to practice and improve.
