Dear Mr. Wolf.
            I was sad not to have been 
over to say good – bye to you personally
before leaving Chatto’s, so this is 
just to say how very much I enjoyed
working for you during my time 
at the office. I am sorry that I wasn’t 
able to stay and see the last volume
of your autobiography through to pub-
lication. 
           I am about to start a 
part – time job for one of the Observer 
editors, Colin Legun, who you probably
know is the Middle East and Africa 
counterpart for the papers: Hewarth 
Sune– are to work at his home (unintelligible)
dealing with his non – 
newspaper activities. I know that much of 
what I have learnet helping with Chatto 
and Hewarth works will not be very useful, and
as I know very little about the subject
that I shall be dealing with I should be
constantly learning which I think is a very 
good thing. 
           Please do not (unintelligible) bother to answer
this. I am sure you have lot of 
other letters to reply to. 
           I do hope you are getting very 
much better and enjoying what sun 
you may be having in Sussex. It’s 
rainy and sunny less alternatively.
                 With all best wishes, 
                            Yours sincerely
                                             Annabel
