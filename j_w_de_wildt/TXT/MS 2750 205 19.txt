Dr. Ernest Jones,

Sussex.

Dear Dr. Jones,

	I have had a letter from ‘Vision’ asking permission to
Reprint an extract from your ‘Essays in Applied Psychology’.
This book is, of course, in The Psycho-analyical Library and
It is among those the rights of wich we bought for a sum down
In 1924. It is out of print at the moment but I think it very
Important that eventually we should be able to reprint it for the Library
	I presume that all they wish to publish is an extract,
Namely the study of Hamlet. I should be prepared to allow them
to do this provided that the number of copies in the edition
was limited and that they paid a nominal fee of, say, Fifteen
Guineas. I am therefore writing to them in this sense.

			Yours sincerely,
				P. Low
