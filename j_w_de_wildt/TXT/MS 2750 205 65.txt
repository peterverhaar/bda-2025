			ESSAYS IN APPLIED PSYCHO-ANALYSIS	
	You will see from the letters written by Mr. Woolf in your
absence on holiday that there is one to Dr. Jones, in which L.W.
recommended publication of the two volumes simultaneously. I
cannot understand why L.W. suggested this, as Vol. 1 will certainly
be ready before Vol. II. Dr. Jones came into the office after
he received L.W.’s letter and in your absence I interviewed him.
He was critical of L.W.’s suggestion to publish simultaneously as
he thought that by publishing separately more review space would
be obtained in the press, and thereby help to improve sales. He
also thought that separate publication was quite feasible from the
content point of view, as the two volumes were not related in 
subject matter. However, he said he was quite willing to bide
by our longer publishing experience in this matter.

	One other point. Dr. Jones has now produced an original
photograph of the Frontispiece picture he requires to go into
Vol. II. I have this on my desk.

	I shall be glad to have a decision on the publication angle,
although I have instructed Clarks to put ‘1951’ on the title page
of Vol 1. The quires are not promised until the end of October
and publication could not be made much before January 1st even
if we decided to publish separately.
