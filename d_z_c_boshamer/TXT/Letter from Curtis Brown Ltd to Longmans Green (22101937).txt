Dear Mr. Pike:

Thank you very much for your prompt
telegram allowing us to go ahead with PEPITA by C. Sackville-
West as the Book-of-the-Month selection. Doubleday do not
have Canada in their contract and I cabled my London office
to get in touch with Hogarth who do control it and the 
answer was that it was satisfactory to Hogarth for the Book-
of -the-Month Club to send copies into Canada, provided you
would accept a royalty of five cents a copy. As you know, 
the Book-of-the-Month pays but 14¢ a copy total and the
14¢ must be divided 50% to the publisher and 50% to the 
author. I assume from the Hogarth cable that of the 
seven cents going to the publisher, they propose you
take 5¢ and themselves 2¢.

The Book-of-the-Month will pay all monies due to 
Doubleday and will render a statement to them of the
number of copies sent to Canada. Doubleday will pay 
this office and by then, I suppose, we shall have Hogarth’s
authorization to divide the money.

Sincerely yours,
(Signed) Alan Collins.
