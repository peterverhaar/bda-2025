Dear Leonard,

I expect you will want to
answer the enclosed. As you will
remember, ALL PASSION SPENT is one of
the titles for the New Phoenix Library
and the position, when last discussed, was 
that you should write to her about 
royalties as soon as we knew exactly 
what the costs were to be. We havenâ€™t
got any facts yet so I cannot tell you
what we are going to propose, but if you
are writing to her anyway, it might be
worthwhile mentioning our intention to
reprint.

Yours ever,

Leonard Woolf Esq.,
The Monks House,
Rodmell,
Nr. Lewes, Sussex.
