<h1>About Me ⊹₊⟡⋆</h1>
<img src="me.jpg">
<p> Hello! My name is Denisé; I speak English and Dutch. </p>
<h2>✮ Hobbies and Interests </h2>
<p>
    As an English Literature graduate and Book and Digital Media student I feel obligated to begin this section with some information on what I have been reading lately. 
    My current read is <i>Aurora's End</i> by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, 
    though, to be honest, I've mostly been focused on the <i>Impulse</i> (1995) comic run.
    To be even more honest, my time spent reading fanfiction greatly surpasses both of those combined... oops?
</p> 
<p>
    Some of my current favorite movies in no particular order:
    <ul>
        <li><i>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</i> (2023)
        <li><i>Whisper of the Heart</i> (1995)</li>
        <li><i>Stardust</i> (2007) = my nostalgia pick ♡</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>✮ Previous Education </h2>
<p>
    Before this Master, I obtained a Bachelor's in <a href= "https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/bachelor/english-language-and-culture" target="_blank">English Language and Culture</a> here at Leiden University, with a specialisation in literature. 
    I wrote my thesis on community-created representation in fanfiction, which I explored through analysis of content revolving around three of DC Comics’ Robins and their relation — or lack thereof — to marginalized communities in America
    (<a href= "https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/4258069" target="_blank">here is the abstract</a> if you are interested in knowing a bit more!). 
</p>    
<p>
    In the final year of my Bachelor studies, I followed the DH-track of the <a href= "https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/centre-for-digital-humanities/education/dh-and-ai-minor-15-or-30-ec#core-digital-humanities-track" target="_blank">Digital Humanities minor</a>. 
    I really enjoyed the courses I followed, and the minor is part of the reason I decided to apply to this Master's programme.

<h2>✮ Course Expectations and Prior Knowledge </h2>
<table style="width: 100;">
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 20%;">Prior Knowledge</td> 
        <td>    The DH minor introduced me to a variety of technical skills, 
    such as basic programming for text analysis and data visualisation using Python and R,
    and alternative ways to present information in a more enticing way for the reader, as opposed to a traditional research paper, such as creating interactive timelines or text-based games. 
    Memorably, I acted as Porject Manager for the creation of a digital edition of a pamphlet. This project included (but was not limited to) imaging, transcribing, and TEI editing/encoding.
    Finally, I have some experience using HTML and CSS. </td>

    <tr>
        <td>Expectations</td> 
        <td>I hope to further develop my technical skills during the "Book in the Digital Age" course, 
            especially for applications which were not the focus of my minor. 
            Furthermore, I am excited to learn more about the ways in which the digital age affects the book industry, 
            mainly in regards to new mediums which exist alongside the printed book and the increased interference/influence of the reader.
