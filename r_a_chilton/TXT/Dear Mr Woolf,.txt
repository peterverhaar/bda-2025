Dear Mr Woolf, 
	. Thanks extremely 
for your kind letter. I was 
glad that you like the book. 
	I shall prepare a 
pamphlet of 10,000 words 
and sincerely hope you 
will see your way to 
publish it. The fact that 
the commission is actually 
taking evidence now and 
will do so until March 
next year marks the 
present time opportune. I 

do not know if I am
wrong in thinking that 
a little publicity in
the right quantity on this
side would have some
weight with the com-
missioners and the 
Colonial Office.
I shall prepare a short
article and send it 
to Ms. Kingsley Martin; and
as soon as it is typed
I shall send you a 
copy of the draft
	yours sincerely
		C.L.R.James
