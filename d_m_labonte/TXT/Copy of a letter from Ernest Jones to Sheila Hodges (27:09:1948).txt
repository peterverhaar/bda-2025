Dear Miss Hodges, 

                   Leonard Woolf of the 
Hogarth Press (40 William IVth St.) has
written to me on other matters, and the 
information he gives incidentally will 
be of interest to you re the American 
rights of my Hamlet.     Apparently
he owns the American rights of my Essays
in Applied Psycho-Analysis of which Hamlet 
was the first chapter (now out of print).
He asks about selling these to the Inter-
national University Press, since apparently 
the book has never appeared in America.
That would of course include the Hamlet. 
I have told him I am writing to you and 
suggesting you come to some arrangement. 

            Actually as soon as he can
get the paper I want to prepare a new 
edition fo the Essays (omitting of course
the Hamlet chapter) and he could sell 
that to America. 

                         Yours sincerely, 
                         
                         Signed...ERNEST JONES.
