            <td>Prior Knowledge</td> <td>I have very limited coding knowledge, having taken only a couple of computer courses at school level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Expectations</td> <td>I would love to better understand coding and eventually to learn more about programming languages over the course of this year. I think this will both expand my skillset and allow me to better understand how programming can be applied to book studies research. I found this exercise very fun and am excited to do more practical lessons. </td>
