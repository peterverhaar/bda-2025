Dear Sir

A Swiss lady is wishing to translate
the Rector's Daughter
into French. She finds that
no Swiss publisher would
take it, unless she
had a formal permission
from the English publisher.
I know you said you
would raise no objection.
[1 word illeg.] could you give me
a written statement to
that effect, that I could
send to her. 

[1 word illeg.]
A. M. Mayor
