Letter from Virginia Woolf to Miss Perkins (01/12/1940)


[[MS 2750/569/1/S]] 


Monk(')s House, Rodmell. Dec 1st 1940

Dear Miss Perkins,

I don(')t think it is any use having a slip
printed. The important correction that I had
proposed to make was to delete two sentences.
And this of course could not be done on a slip.
It puts me into a very awkward position with
the Pierpont Morgans, but I do not see
any help for it. Will you keep the paper of
corrections, in case there should be another
impression. 

We were up on Wednesday, and took away
what we could of the furniture in the car. It is all
being brought down in two vans tomorrow. But the books
are in awful state, and the carpets about three
inches thick in mud and grime. I(')v wonder when we
shall begin furnishing all over again! We have
taken three rooms in the village.

Miss Talbot spent a weekend here, and
longs to be evacuated into the country. But
the Pritchards are going to stay till a bomb actually
falls on the office. 

Yours sincerely

Virginia Woolf
