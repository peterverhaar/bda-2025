<h1>Vasiliki Kouli</h1>
<p><i><b>a.k.a. Vicky</b></i></p>

<p>I am a recent graduate of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens with a degree in English Language and Literature. I am particularly interested in cross-linguistic mediation, innovative approaches to literacy development in EFL classrooms, and books in the digital age. Furthermore, I deeply enjoy theatre, cinema, books, writing and storytelling. I also engage in creative projects such as scrapbooking, journaling and amateur video editing. As a student of our master's program, I am eager to grow and expand my knowledge, and embrace new experiences.</p>
