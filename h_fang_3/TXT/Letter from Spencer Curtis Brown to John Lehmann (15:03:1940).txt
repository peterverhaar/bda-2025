Dear Lehmann,

		Thank you very much for your letter.	       I
quoted it to Ali and we are both somewhat appalled that
you suggest paying no advance whatsoever. I thought an
advance or £25 could not possibly be considered onerous
and I suggest that figure with royalties or 10% on the
first 2,000 copies, 15% on the next 2,000 and 20% thereafter;
your territory to cover the Eritish Empire except Canada
novel on terms to be arranged. I hope that you will wish
to take the book on these terms for I know you will do
everything you can to promote the sales and see that the
book is reviewed in the right quarters. I believe that
the book may have a sale for my own commercial mind
appreaciated it and I believe that others like me say do
so too.

			Yours sincerely,
				Spencer Curtis Brown
