Dear Lehmann,

	Ali does not want to make
difficulties about the Â£5 by which you have
reduced his advance and will gladly accept 
the terms outlined in your letter. With
present difficulties of transport we have
usually found that it is easier for the
American publisher than for English one
to supply the Canadian market but if you
feel strongly on that point we will not
make difficulties. I am having the
contract drawn up and will send it to you
in a day or two.

		Yours sincerly,
		Spencer Curtis Brown
