    <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Brief Theo-ism</b></h2>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
    My name is Hongyi “Theo” Fang, and the name “Theo” originates from my early Internet nickname “気後”. This nickname combines two Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciation: “Ki'ato” in Japanese and “Qi'hou” in Chinese. Over time, this became the source of my English name “Theo”. Coincidentally, the two characters are also homophonic with “气候”, meaning “climate”, which I find quite amusing.

    <p style="text-align:center;">
    Although my major was in English Language and Literature, I shifted my interests toward continental philosophy and the broader realm of <i>Geisteswissenschaft</i>, deliberately avoiding terminology oriented toward quantitative or scientific approaches.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>About this course</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        E-books, Tiktok-like fragmental contents, digital piracy... technological developments are undeniably pushing our reading culture into a new era. In this distance-yet-immediate and cyborgian epoch, what and how should a book reader, a book lover and someone who work with book do, should be discussed and treated deliberately. Hope to gain more thoughts and more insights during this course.
