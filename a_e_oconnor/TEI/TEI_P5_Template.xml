                        Dear Mr. Woolf,
                    </salute>
                </opener>
                <p>
I have been working daily on the serial situa-<lb/>
tion with reference to "FLUSH." As you know, "Good<lb/>
Housekeeping" have now reluctantly come to the final<lb/>
conclusion - as was the case previously with "Woman's<lb/>
Journal" - that the subtle qualities of this work<lb/>
could not be sufficiently well conveyed in monthly<lb/>
instalments to make a monthly magazine a suitable<lb/> 
medium. This view I find is shared by the editor of<lb/>
the "Strand", in spite of the fact that he is anxiously<lb/>
seeking for material of a somewhat less obvious nature<lb/>
than that which they have tended to run in the past:<lb/>
and was therefore particularly grateful for being given<lb/>
the opportunity of considering the present MS.<lb/>
                </p>
<p>
There are still such mediums as the "Telegraph"<lb/>
and "Evening Standard" with whom one might discuss the<lb/>
possibilities - though their space is, generally speak-<lb/>
ing, very restricted at present:- but first I shall be<lb/>
glad to know how you view the following suggestion which<lb/>
comes from "Time and Tide":-<lb/>
</p>
<p>
I am frequently asked by Lady Rhondda to give her<lb/>
the chance of acquiring material of first-class impor-<lb/>
tance: on the understanding that she will endeavour, in<lb/>
such cases, to put forward offers at a considerably higher<lb/>
rate than that ruling in the weekly field as a whole: and<lb/>
I therefore rang her up tentatively in the matter the<lb/>
other day: without, that is to say, actually showing her<lb/>
the MS. until I knew how you would view "Time and Tide"
<pb/>
as a medium. She is, as I anticipated, intensly<lb/>
interested, and is asking whether - Mrs. Woolf<lb/>
having agreed that it might be out for serial pur-<lb/>
poses - she would consider a proposal to run, say,<lb/>
roughly Twenty Thousand Words in seven parts at<lb/>
Seventy-Five Pounds for First British Serial Rights<lb/>
only:- with the further possibility of running an<lb/>
eighth instalment.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
I think there would be no doubt but that we could<lb/>
arrange publication so as to make way for the appear-<lb/>
ance of the book in June, as you plan, and to arrange<lb/>
further that "Time and Tide" run a line making it quite<lb/>
clear that it will be published by the Hogarth Press.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
May I than know how you would like me to proceed<lb/>
with "Time and Tide" - with whom, by the way, I have<lb/>
not argued at all as yet on the price basis: waiting<lb/>
first to hear your views.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Miss Head, by the way, was most anxious that I<lb/>
should say how keenly she is looking forward to the<lb/>
chance of securing for "Good Housekeeping" the continus-<lb/>
tion of "A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN", if and when this materialises,<lb/>
as discussed with Mrs. Woolf.
