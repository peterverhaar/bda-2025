Dear Mr. Woolf,

	I have been working daily on the serial situa- /
tion with reference to "FLUSH." As you know, "Good /
Housekeeping" have now reluctantly come to the final /
conclusion - as was the case previously with "Woman's /
Journal" - that the subtle qualities of this work /
could not be sufficiently well conveyed in monthly /
instalments to make a monthly magazine a suitable /
medium. This view I find is shared by the editor of /
the "Strand", in spite of the fact that he is anxiously /
seeking for material of a somewhat less obvious nature /
than that which they have tended to run in the past: /
and was therefore particularly grateful for being given /
the opportunity of considering the present MS. /

	There are still such mediums as the "Telegraph" /
and "Evening Standard" with whom one might discuss the /
possibilities - though their space is, generally speak- /
ing, very restricted at present:- but first I shall be /
glad to know how you view the following suggestion which /
comes from "Time and Tide":- /

	I am frequently asked by Lady Rhondda to give her/
the chance of acquiring material of first-class impor- /
tance: on the understanding that she will endeavour, in /
such cases, to put forward offers at a considerably higher /
rate than that ruling in the weekly field as a whole: and /
I therefore rang her up tentatively in the matter the /
other day: without, that is to say, actually showing her /
the MS. until I knew how you would view "Time and Tide" /
~next page~
as a medium. She is, as I anticipated, intensly /
interested, and is asking whether - Mrs. Woolf /
having agreed that it might be out for serial pur- /
poses - she would consider a proposal to run, say, /
roughly Twenty Thousand Words in seven parts at /
Seventy-Five Pounds for First British Serial Rights /
only:- with the further possibility of running an /
eighth instalment. /

	I think there would be no doubt but that we could /
arrange publication so as to make way for the appear- /
ance of the book in June, as you plan, and to arrange /
further that "Time and Tide" run a line making it quite /
clear that it will be published by the Hogarth Press. /

	May I than know how you would like me to proceed /
with "Time and Tide" - with whom, by the way, I have /
not argued at all as yet on the price basis: waiting /
first to hear your views. /

	Miss Head, by the way, was most anxious that I /
should say how keenly she is looking forward to the /
chance of securing for "Good Housekeeping" the continus- /
tion of "A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN", if and when this materialises, /
as discussed with Mrs. Woolf. /

Yours sincerely,
{illegible}
