        <p>Hello! I'm Yiling Chen (陈依灵 in Chinese) and come from China. I studied Chinese Language
            and Literature for my BA in <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/ ">Nanjing
            University</a>, which is located at Nanjing, a beautiful city with many museums and
            well-preserved old Chinese architecture. Besides, I've spent one semester in <a
                href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> as an exchange
            student, where I did some courses in creative writing and film studies. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love reading poetry, writing, watching films, collecting old photos
            and visiting museums. I enjoy wandering around the cities or countryside to look for
            something interesting. Meanwhile I always like to travel and explore different culture
            and society. I've travelled to England, Australia, Indonesia and many other wonderful
            countries. Actually I have already visited the Netherlands and other European countries
            in my 14 and now I'm doing very well here:) </p>
