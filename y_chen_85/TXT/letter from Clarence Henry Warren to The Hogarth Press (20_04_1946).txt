Dear Sirs,

In reply to
your enquiry concerning my 
anthology the good life (Eyre 
& Spottiswoode), this has not 
yet been published. For 
reasons which will be all too 
familiar to you, it has been 
continually held up. It is 
hoped, however, that the book 
will appear this summer; , 
of course, as soon as it is 
published, the fee for Mr. Frank 
Prewett's poem will be forwarded 
to you.

Yours faithfally
C. Henry Warren
