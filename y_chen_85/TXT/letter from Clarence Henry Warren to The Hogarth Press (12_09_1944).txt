Dear Sirs,
I am editing an Anthology called THE GOOD LIFE,
to be published next year by Messrs Eyre and Spottiswoode,
and wish to include the following poem:

Frank Prewett: Be Kind to Animals (from Poems)

If permission can be granted, would you kindly let me know
the fee required covering (a) Britain and the World, and
(b) the U. S. A. I am not sure yet whether we shall be able
to publish in the U. S. A. , but we shall make every effort
to place the volume there.

We shall, of course, make the fullest acknowlegde-
ment to Author and Publisher.

Yours faithfully,
C. Henry Warren
