Dear Miss Lange, /
Many thanks for your letter. /
I enclose a few biographical details for / 
the Book Society News. I have not  ~ c. 1 word illegible~ photograph /
of myself in my possession, but Howard /
~c. 1 word illegible~ has recently done a very good one. I /
don’t know whether there is any possibility /
that ~crossed out word~ the Book Society might /
be prepared to buy one from him: if not, /
please let me know and I will obtain one. /
I have just received from John J. /
Tronnstine ~unclear~ of New York an inquiry as /
to whether any arrangements have been /
made to publishing my book in America. /
If no arrangements have been made, would/
~next page~
there be any objection to permitting him /
to look for a publisher there? /
/
Yours sincerely, /
Edward Upward.
