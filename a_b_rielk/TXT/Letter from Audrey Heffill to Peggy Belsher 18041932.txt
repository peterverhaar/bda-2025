Dear Miss Belsher,
Would you be so kind as to let me know /
the dates on which the amounts making up /
advance royalties of £800 on All Passion Spent /
were paid. I have only got two amounts ~ misspelling corrected, one m crossed out~, /
viz. £300 in May and £300 in November, and as /
Mrs. Nicolson is away from Long Barn I have /
no means of finding out, except through you, /
and I must know for Income Tax returns. I am /
so sorry to worry you. /
/
Yours sincerely, /
Audrey Heffill /
Secretary.
