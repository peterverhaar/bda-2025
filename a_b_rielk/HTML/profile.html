        <p> Hello, everyone! My name is Annika, but you can call me Annie.
            I grew up in the beautiful South of Germany and spent a year in England after finishing my A-levels. First I worked as an au pair, but later I worked in an independent bookshop, which I absolutely loved. 
            Afterwards, I started studying English and Amercian Studies as a major and Archaeology as a minor at the <a href= "https://uni-freiburg.de/en/"> University of Freiburg </a>.</p>
        <p> In summer 2022, I graduated and decided to take some time off. So, my best friends and I packed our bags and went on a three and a half months-long road trip around the British Isles and Ireland which was absolutely magical.
            We had so much fun, in fact, that we decided to do the same thing again a couple of months later, this time travelling around Italy, Greece and Croatia. 
            Once the travel bug has bitten you, it's sheer impossible to get rid off it. 
            So, after taking on different jobs over the past two years, we flew to New Zealand this March. 
            An absolutely stunning country and a once-in-a-lifetime experience; but who knows, maybe I will find a way to go again.</p>
        <p> Nevertheless, I did start missing the academic environment and so I decided to come back to studying something that I love above most things in life - books!
