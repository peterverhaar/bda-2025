IMP/HG.


Dear Leonard,

     Eunice Frost of Penguins has just sent
me the enclosed draft blurb for their edition
of "The Waves". A copy of their covering
letter is also enclosed. I have told her
that I felt sure you would like to see it
personally, and that I would ask you to
return it direct to her with any comments
that you may have.

	       Yours,










Leonard Woolf, Esq.,
Monks House,
Rodmell,
Near Lewes, Sussex.
