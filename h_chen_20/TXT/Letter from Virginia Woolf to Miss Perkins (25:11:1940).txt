Letter from Virginia Woolf to Miss Perkins (25/11/1940)

MS 2750/569/1/3



Monks House, Rodmell, Lewes.

25th Nov. 1940


Dear Miss Perkins,

	  I see from an advertisement yesterday in the
Sunday Times that a third impression of Roger Fry is
being prepared. I wish I had known before. I hope
there is still time to make the corrections I enclose
on this page.

     There are two others that I have had to
agree to make, owing to an appeal from
Pierpont Morgan's son. These are:
to delete on page 140 (near the beginning)
the senetnce that begins "I knew the answer beforehand..."
and to delete on page 144 (in the middle) the
senetnnce beginning "I always wondered...."

      I hope this is clear.

I wonder how you like Letchworth? It seems an age since
we saw you and Miss Griffiths. We are having to
bring down all the furniture in the flat, as it is
getting waterlogged. What a bore it all is--
Here we have had a tremendous flood, owing to a
bomb bursting the river bank. And the usual
Excitements of seeing planes shot down.

	    I hope you and Miss Griffiths will come here
if you ever want --well, I cant say its exactly a
peaceful place. But we dont get bombs at night.

		Yours sincerely
		    Virginia Woolf
