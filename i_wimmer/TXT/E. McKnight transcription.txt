Letter from E. McKnight Kauffer to Leonard Woolf (05/04/1935)

My dear Leonard, 
I am enclosing two very rough
'roughs' for your cover design. "A" design
is based on the mark enclosed. Perhaps
these are too vulgar - perhaps too restricted
in symbolism - I think however that 
they should not be tentative in suggestion, 
but bold and different. I can do a sketch
montage if you prefer it - but these 
roughs strike me as being different 
and to the (point?). If you decide l can
finish the design in a day or two. 
All my best wishes
Yours sincerely, 
E. McKnight Kauffer
