Dear Mr. Woolf: 
Thank you for writing me so promptly in regard to 
the question of a limited edition of Mrs. Woolf's new novel. 
The situation here in regard to limited editions is very much 
the same now as on your side, and also we share your feeling 
about the system of limited editions. My idea was that if
you and Mrs. Woolf wanted a limited edition, we should be glad
to produce one. The limited edition of ORLANDO did provide
a substantial amount of royalty. Although I am sure we coul
not expect to market as large an edition as in that case, 
there would still be a certain addition to the royalty earnings
from it. 
Since my earlier letter, I have made some inquiries
and given the question further thought. I am inclined to 
favor abandoning a limited edition this time, especially since
you yourselves are not enthusiastic about it. As far as I 
can see, we could not hope to place more than 350 copies
here successfully, and even that number would not be easy. 
In a time of such restricted buying, I believe it would be as
well not to attempt it. Of course, we could still change our
minds if it seems desirable later on. 
Whith kind regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Donald. C. Brace
