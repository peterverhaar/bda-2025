    <h1><i>A little bit about me</i></h1>
    <img src="me.gif" alt="ME"/> 
    <p>Hello! My name is Isi, and I am a 25-year-old from Austria. My parents are Romanian, so I grew up bilingual. At 15, I went on an exchange year to Argentina, where I learned to speak Spanish, too. This is helping me a lot right now, as I have found a job at Casa Ramon, 5 min from Lipsius (come visit sometime!). For my undergraduate degree, I studied Social Anthropology at <a href= "https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">the University of Manchester</a> (which has come up a few times in class, yey). Ever since, I have worked in the Film & TV industry for three years before moving back home to work as a Translator and save up some money to do a Master's, and here I am now! I am also a cat person.</p>
    <p>The languages I speak:
    <ul>
        <li>German</li>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Romanian</li>
        <li>Spanish</li>
    </ul>
    <table style="width: 100%">
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 20%">Prior Knowledge</td><td>I have a blog, which I used Wix for, so my prior knowledge is minimal because no coding is necessary with such a software.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Expectation</td><td>How to make a website and write, format, insert text digitally. Bridge the gap between the physical nature of the other two courses with digital skills.</td>
        </tr>
